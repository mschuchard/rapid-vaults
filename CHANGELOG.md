TODO: add gpg; add string output option for generate/encrypt for api and update doc/tests; use .auth_data like a password optionally; tighten api tests; allow for multiple files at once? have a settings file and a settings text; improve encrypt/decrpyt failure messages; maybe combo ssl and gpg for way too much security?
