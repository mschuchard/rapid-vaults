### Roadmap
TODO: add gpg cli/main/encrypt/decrypt/generate?; allow for multiple files at once? have a settings file and a settings text; improve encrypt/decrpyt failure messages; redesign action classes to have different methods depending upon whether cli or api and then main class main method looks like what? well maybe api accesses methods directly with some kind of wrapper built into the api class; cli returns settings to main/api passes settings to main
